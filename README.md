# Food-Reviews
"We want to build a model for a Resturant to predict if the reviews of the customers are positive or negative ,so we downloaded a dataset from kaggle and read it ,chose columns from which give us information benifit us and put them in a new dataframe . we cleaned the dataframe " dropped duplicates and Removed stop words " and applied stemming , convert scors to binary categories " score >=3 = 1, score &lt;3=0 " . but before the pre procissing we chose a sample from data to work on it because data set is very big and waste alot of time while running any code . we have found positive labels greater than nagative labels by plot ,so we make Data balanced to choose positive labels equal negative labels to predict better. Then we split data set to training set and test set , vectorized them ,then initialized our model , fitted training set and transformed training set and test set to build our model . saved it for Deployment then loaded again and tested " ... also mention the link of the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews
